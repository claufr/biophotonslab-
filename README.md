Center for Biophotonics Education and Research A principal goal of the Center for Biophotonics Education and Research (CBER) is to maintain strong and national/global visible presence in a number of thrust research areas of excellence that have applications of relevance and societal impact. Our vision is to further strengthen the already strong research areas, while expanding into new applications of current interest. Because of the inherent cross-disciplinary nature of optics &amp; biophotonics, coordination with other Universities and associated labs units can yield win-win results and accelerate overall research in science and technology at the Center for Biophotonics Education and Research (CBER). We should also be cognizant of the instructional needs of our future undergraduate program. For example, an external review of Biophotonics programs in Europe noted some deficiency in the area of optical engineering (optical system design), which we have been addressing.
